With the following input I managed to commit SQL injection:
<put your 'solution' here>

My first solution was to write something like:
    '); DROP TABLE todos; --'
    However, this did not work as it triggered a syntax error fir the insert statement: ERROR: INSERT has more target columns than expression

Next step was to try to insert all the data and then a drop table at the end which worked:
    item1 + ',' + item2 + ',' + item3 + '); DELETE FROM todos;--'
    However this approach is based on the fact that the attacker knows the number of input params the query takes.

cal + ',' + calut + ',' + altceva + '); DELETE FROM todos;--
